# Univeth 📿

**`IT Student in the EU. Intermediate at best on a good day...`**

#### I'm an IT Technology student hailing from the EU. My main passion is the Cybersec field, but I generally love everything regarding different technologies. I often find myself daydreaming about a Solarpunkish future 🌇

#### Programming/Scripting languages I'm the most focused on right now:
